          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
          Lorem Ipsum has been the industryâ€™s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
          type specimen book.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
          typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
          with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.
